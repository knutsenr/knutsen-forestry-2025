Rowan Knutsen 2025.
Github for my project in the 2025 introduction to web development for learning designers. 

## Design
I went for the hybrid design [both multiple documents and multiple pages in a document] so I could gain experience with both. The general navigation is currently

### Pages and Navigation
HOME page contains a slightly altered version of the page I turned in last week. The navigation at the top as well as the ARTICLES button will take you to articles.html which will be the page where you can select different documents to view. Selecting the Example Article option will take you to the Example Article page. From any of these three pages the user can navigate back to home or the articles page from the top left. 

The home page is managed from index.html and the general articles page as well as the example article page are both managed through articles.html. 

## Issues
I anticipate some issues with layout and with images, especially background images since I do not entirely understand how those work and I am particularly bad at understanding sizing and what looks good or bad. I do not have a particularly good mind for design and layout and I tend to go for bare-bones construction so I will do my best with the css but I do worry how it will end up looking.

My project will need these three pages as well as dropdown options to send a user to their file pages or to save to your files from the page you are currently on. I do not know how to do drop downs so this does not exist yet.

#### Note:
Note to self: Had some issues with having two git accounts on my computer and missing permissions. When this was not sorted through --global user.name, it was sorted with (after fighting with it for far too long) --global credential.username. The more you know. So far most issues I have had w/ pushing from local to remote have been either resetting the url or resetting the username in some way.
