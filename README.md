Rowan Knutsen 2025.
Github for my project in the 2025 introduction to web development for learning designers. 

### Newly Added
- Both emails at the bottom of the page should open the email app with mailto: in their links.
- Added background image
- All links to Article, Home, and Example Article pages are working
- Cleaned up CSS Visuals
- Created JS script which will create article listings from an array rather than doing each manually
- Nav bar sticks to top of screen

### Pages and Navigation
## Files
**index.html** contains the home page
**articles.html** contains all articles + example article page
**style.css** contains all css for project
**script.js** contians all javascript for project. articleList.js is currently not interacting with the program so the article array is housed in script.js.

## Navigation
From Home one can use the Articles selector at the top of the page OR the Articles button under the Resources section.
The Articles page lists a series of articles selected from a javascript list. All of these are examples still and connect to the same Example Article page.

## To Do 
Next:
- Functional search bar
- Your Files drop down
- Add PDFs for articles
